                <h3>Doulabi</h3>
                <p style="text-justify: auto; text-align: justify;">
                    From a shy, withdrawn girl facing trauma and family hardship, Doulabi transformed into a confident,
                    high-achieving student at Sanrakshan Rainbow Home. With counselling, activities, and consistent
                    support, she excelled academically (93% marks), built strong bonds with peers and staff, and became a
                    role model for younger girls, including her sister Yasmin. Her journey shows the power of love, care,
                    and a safe environment in unlocking a child’s true potential.

                <h3>Anjum</h3>
                <p style="text-justify: auto; text-align: justify;">
                    Anjum arrived at the Sanrakshan Rainbow Home at age 7, frightened and unable to trust others after
                    being found begging on the streets despite having parents unable to care for her. Initially sensitive
                    and insecure, she struggled to adjust to the new environment. Through steady counselling, emotional
                    support, and a structured routine, Anjum gradually felt safe, began attending school regularly, and
                    developed confidence. She now participates in activities, studies with enthusiasm, and has become a
                    cheerful, connected, and affectionate child. Her progress reflects the transformative power of
                    consistent care and support.

                <h3>Lakshmi R</h3>
                <p style="text-justify: auto; text-align: justify;">
                    Lakshmi R, a 21-year-old, grew up in a large, financially struggling family after losing her father early
                    in life. She joined the home five years ago while studying in 8th standard, seeking stability and
                    support. With consistent care, guidance, and encouragement, Lakshmi rebuilt her confidence and stayed
                    focused on her education. She completed her SSLC in 2023 and later finished her PUC under the Future
                    Program, reflecting steady progress and determination. Grateful for the emotional and educational
                    support she received, Lakshmi now stands as an inspiring example of perseverance. She aims to build a
                    stable career and hopes to motivate other children facing similar challenges.

                <h3>Mamatha</h3>
                <p style="text-justify: auto; text-align: justify;">
                    Mamatha, who came from a financially challenged family with an ailing father, joined Sanrakshan Rainbow
                    Home in 8th grade, struggling with academics and emotional stress. Through consistent counselling,
                    activity-based engagement in dance and cultural programs, and supportive staff check-ins, she gradually
                    gained confidence, discovered her strengths,                    and developed leadership skills. Today,
                    she has completed 10th standard with excellent marks, actively participates in school and hostel
                    activities, and serves as a role model for her peers—a true example of how encouragement and structured
                    support can transform resilience into success.
